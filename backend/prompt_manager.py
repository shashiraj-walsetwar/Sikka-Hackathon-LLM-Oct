Current Project: {project_name}

CRITICAL API INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT:
You MUST use the following Sikka APIs in your solution where applicable. These are not optional - they are the core APIs that should be integrated into every relevant project feature:

{api_documentation}

API Integration Priority:
1. ALWAYS check and use available Sikka APIs first for any functionality
2. Only consider third-party APIs for features not covered by Sikka APIs
3. If using both, Sikka APIs should be the primary integration with third-party APIs as supplements

Key Instructions:
1. Begin every feature design by identifying relevant Sikka APIs
2. Map project requirements to available Sikka API endpoints
3. Create complete files with full content
4. Use proper Windows paths with backslashes
5. Include all necessary setup steps
6. Provide production-ready code with best practices
7. Include proper error handling and logging
8. Add appropriate comments and documentation

Integration Requirements:
1. MANDATORY: Integrate relevant Sikka APIs for core features
2. Document which Sikka APIs are used for each feature
3. Include proper error handling for API calls
4. Add appropriate authentication
5. Follow API documentation for request/response formats
6. Include example API usage in comments
7. Add proper error messages for API failures
8. Justify any use of third-party APIs when Sikka APIs don't cover the functionality

Tech Stack:
{tech_stack}

Additional Requirements:
{additional_requirements if additional_requirements else '- None specified'}

Response Format:
1. Project Analysis:
   - Project overview
   - Core features and required Sikka APIs for each feature
   - Architecture design highlighting Sikka API integration points
   - Complete API integration mapping
   - Database schema
   - Endpoint documentation

2. API Integration Plan:
   - List of Sikka APIs to be used
   - Mapping of features to specific Sikka API endpoints
   - Any supplementary third-party APIs (only if necessary)
   - Integration architecture and flow

3. Step-by-step instructions with:
   - Detailed explanation
   - Complete code blocks showing Sikka API integration
   - API integration examples
   - Expected results
   - Testing instructions

Remember to:
- Use complete file contents
- Include all dependencies
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Provide clear instructions
- Follow security best practices
- Include unit tests
- Add logging
- Include data validation
- Handle edge cases
- Provide deployment instructions
- Document ALL API integrations
- Prioritize Sikka APIs in every feature
- When asked for code, give step by step instructions starting from setup to deployment. Assume that the user is a tech newbie and guide accordingly.

Analysis Requirements for Each Feature:
1. Available Sikka APIs for the feature
2. How to implement using Sikka APIs
3. Any gaps in functionality
4. Only then consider supplementary APIs if needed

Please analyze this project request and provide:
1. Project name and description
2. Core features and their corresponding Sikka API mappings
3. Complete technical specifications
4. Detailed Sikka API integration plan
5. Supplementary API requirements (if any)
6. Detailed setup and deployment steps
7. Testing and validation procedures

For each feature you develop, explicitly state which Sikka APIs you're using and why. If you must use a third-party API, explain why the Sikka APIs couldn't fulfill that specific requirement."""
